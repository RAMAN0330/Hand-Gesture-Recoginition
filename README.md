# Gesture-Recognition-TensorFlow-Keras

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify gesture images from the Kaggle dataset. The goal is to build a model that can accurately distinguish between different hand gestures.

## Introduction

The Gesture-Recognition-TensorFlow-Keras project aims to leverage Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for gesture classification. By training on a labeled dataset of hand gesture images, the CNN model learns to identify key features that distinguish different gestures.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Implementation of CNN using TensorFlow and Keras
- Model training and evaluation
- Support for custom datasets
- Visualization of results

## Data Description

The dataset used for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset [LeapGestRecog](https://www.kaggle.com/gti-upm/leapgestrecog). The dataset contains images of different hand gestures captured using the Leap Motion sensor.

### Sample Data

The dataset consists of several main folders, each corresponding to a different gesture. Each folder contains numerous images of that particular gesture.

### Data Source

The data used in this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset [LeapGestRecog](https://www.kaggle.com/gti-upm/leapgestrecog). Ensure your dataset is in a similar format for compatibility.
